📊 Analysis of Marketing Channels and Profitability Opportunity 
This project explores the performance of marketing channels to uncover opportunities for balancing cost and customer acquisition. The analysis identifies underutilized platforms like TikTok, evaluates cost-efficiency across channels, and provides strategic recommendations to improve ROAS and optimize budget allocation.

📁 Overview
The analysis tests the hypothesis that TikTok is underutilized, as indicated by its absence in early campaign data, while Google is over-relied on despite high costs. By comparing traffic performance, conversion rates, and ROAS, this project identifies gaps and uncovers untapped potential for cost-effective marketing.

🧮 Data Preparation
The following tables and sources were used to prepare the data:

Sessions

Transactions

Funnel Events

Ad Platform Data

Product Costs

Product Attributes

Data was cleaned and aggregated using SQL (BigQuery), ensuring key metrics could be calculated: ROAS, AOV, conversion rate, and traffic channel performance.

🎯 Objectives
Highlight high-performing and low-performing marketing channels

Discover underutilized opportunities for customer acquisition

Provide clear, actionable recommendations to improve campaign ROI

🔍 Key Insights
🔹 Google
Drives the highest click volume, customer acquisition, and average order value

Displays strong funnel progression, especially via organic traffic

However, it has the highest cost and a lower ROAS, impacting overall efficiency

🔹 RTB House
Demonstrates the highest ROAS among platforms

ROAS peaked in Q2 2020, dipped, then rebounded in Q2 2021 alongside Meta and Google

Maintains consistent conversions, similar to Google, but at a lower cost

🔹 TikTok
Shows notable conversion performance despite lower usage

Presents a valuable opportunity for growth with further investment or experimentation

Underrepresented in early data, supporting the hypothesis of being underused

💡 Recommendations
Optimize Google ad spend to maintain conversions while reducing cost

Increase investment in RTB House to capitalize on its strong ROAS

Experiment with TikTok, focusing on creative formats and targeting younger audiences

Analyze Q4 2021 campaign trends to replicate successful strategies in future efforts

🛠️ Tools Used
BigQuery (SQL) – For data extraction and transformation

Excel, Power BI & PowerPoint – For analysis and presentation of insights

📌 Outcome
The analysis supports more diversified and cost-effective channel strategies. With better targeting, reallocation of budget, and focused experimentation, Prism can reduce marketing costs while improving customer acquisition and engagement.
