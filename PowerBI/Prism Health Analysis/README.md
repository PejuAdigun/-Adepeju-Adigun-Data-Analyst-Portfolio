🔍 Key Insights

ROAS (Return on Ad Spend):
ROAS stands at 3%, meaning only £0.03 is generated in revenue per pound spent — a sign that ad campaigns may not be well targeted, or ad costs are too high.

Ad Spend Distribution:
Google dominates ad spend with better targeting outcomes, while Meta and other platforms make smaller contributions. Heavy reliance on Google poses risks (e.g., cost shifts, competition, algorithm changes).

Conversion Rate:
Average over the period is 1.01%. The rate fluctuates, likely due to seasonal impacts or inconsistent campaign targeting.

Refund Rate:
High at 18.63%. This suggests dissatisfaction potentially stemming from product quality or service issues, requiring further deep dive.

Retention Rate:
Currently 29.68%, showing a downward trend. This appears to correlate with the rising refund rate — unsatisfied customers are less likely to return.

📌 Recommendations
Improve Targeting & Diversify Channels:
Reduce reliance on Google by reallocating budget to test underutilized platforms and optimize ad creatives per audience segment.

Audit Refunds:
Investigate key drivers behind the high refund rate (e.g., product quality, service delivery, customer expectations).

Boost Conversions:
Analyse landing page performance, traffic quality, and user journey drop-offs to increase conversion rates.

Retention Focus:
Enhance loyalty programs, personalize re-engagement strategies, and prioritize high-value customer segments.

Monitor ROI Continuously:
Implement regular review of channel-specific ROAS and performance to inform dynamic budget allocation.
